                <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
                <p>The <i>PostPad</i> platform was created as a <i>&quot;safe haven&quot;</i> for its users, so they don't have to worry about huge corporations controlling a social media website.</p>
                <p>To provide the services of the platform and to make it a safe place for everyone, the users will have to abide by certain rules to use the platform.</p>
                <br>
                <ul style="list-style: none;">
                    <li>
                        <h4 id="minimumage"><small><a href="#minimumage" class="marks">#</a></small> Minimum age for users</h4>
                        <p>
                            As usual, certain rules made by governments regulate the minimum age to use certain platforms on the internet. <br>
                            As a service provider <i>PostPad</i> also has to abide by these rules. <br>
                            The <strong>minimum</strong> age to use our platform is 13 years of age, however users have to provide their legal guardian's email address <br> and they also have to agree that the user can use the platform. <br>
                            When signing up under the age of 16, the legal guardian is the person who legally agrees to ToS and Privacy Policy. <br>
                            Over 16 years of age, users can legally agree to ToS and Privacy Policy, without the consent of a legal guardian. <br>
                            Keep in mind that users cannot consume NSFW content on the platform unless they are at least 18 years old. <br>
                            Over 18 years of age it is <i>&quot;free game&quot;</i>.
                        </p>

                        <h4 id="contentlicense"><small><a href="#contentlicense" class="marks">#</a></small> Content ownership and licensing</h4>
                        <p>
                            When users post anything on <i>PostPad</i> the post is theirs, unless it contains copyrighted content.
                            <br>Copyrighted content can include but is not limited to:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Leaked or publically available music</li>
                                <li>Leaked or publically available movies</li>
                                <li>Hyperlinks to pirated versions of any software</li>
                            </ul>
                            Despite heavy protection on copyrighted content, legal hyperlinks to content (such as YouTube links to music videos) are allowed on the platform <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When creating a post on <i>PostPad</i> users provide the platform a license to the post, so it can be used in promotional materials, with proper crediting.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Since <i>PostPad</i> is operated out of Hungary, users have to abide by the copyright law(s) and copyright act(s) of the country.
                            <br>For more information, you can read the following document:

                        <p>
                            Since <i>PostPad</i> is managed by a small company with limited resources, the operators are physically unable to oversee every and each post.
                            <br>As such, <i>PostPad</i>, and any related legal entity (be it a person or a company) does <strong>NOT</strong> take any liability for the content posted on the platform.
                            <br>The operators of <i>PostPad</i> will do everything in their powers to stop any type of content that is against the rules of the platform, however
                            <br>the operators do <strong>NOT</strong> have resources to run an algorythm to oversee and analyse the content in every and each post.

                        <p>
                            The providers of the platform can terminate the account of a user who breaks any of the written rules and regulations of the platform
                            <br>or otherwise breaks any of the laws that are applicable to user generated content in Hungary.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If the account of the user is terminated, they will receive an e-mail about the termination and a short reasoning as to why the account was terminated.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If your account has been terminated by the providers of the platform for breaking any of the rules or laws applicable,
                            <br>but you create a new account from a new e-mail address, that is considered <strong>ban evasion</strong>.
                            <br>Ban evasion is forbidden on the platform and will result in immediate termination of the new account upon discovery.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        As the platform works with limited resources (both human and computational),
                        <br>the format for resolving disputes is also limited. Once the platform is in a live phase (i.e. no longer in "beta"),
                        <br>we will provide an email address to receive such requests.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As the platform, its infrastructure and related rules and laws may change at any time,
                            <br>the platform providers reserve the right to change the Terms of Service, the Privacy Policy and the Community Guidelines at any point in time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The providers of the platform will give users a notification about the update to any of them, and give the users time to
                            <br>read the proposed changes, provide feedback, or deactivate their accounts if they don't agree with the changes.
                        </p>
